# LIRI Bot

### Overview

In this assignment, I have made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

#### LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

#### To retrieve the data that will power this app, I need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. I find these Node packages crucial for my assignment.

- [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

- [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

  - I have used Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

- [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

- [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

#### Below you can check the screen shot of my search results.
